# 欢迎使用 Piranha CMS

Piranha CMS is a lightweight framework for building content driven applications using ASP.NET MVC & Web Pages. The main focus of the framework lies in structuring and managing content, not in providing a pre packaged web interface. 

Piranha CMS can be used to build a new application from scratch, or to add CMS functionality to an already existing application.
